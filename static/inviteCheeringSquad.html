		<p>I've decided to take the step to become more active! Since you're my friend, I'm asking for your help to keep me notivated:</p>
		
		<p>For every step I take or mile I run, will you pledge a small incremental donation to a non-profit I care about? For example, a quarter for every mile. Or even a penny.</p>
		
		<p>If not, then you should join my cheering squad to keep up-to-date on my progress.</p>
		
		<p>The cause I've chosen is:</p>
		
		[insert cause blurb]
		
		<p>I've chosen it because:</p>
		
		<p>A close friend of mine was diagnosed with Stage VI breast cancer in August 2011. I want to help rid the world of this terrible disease, as well as bring hope to her and all those like her!</p>
